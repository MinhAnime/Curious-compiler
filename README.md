# Curious Compiler

Curious Compiler is my own custom-built compiler designed specifically for my programming language. This project is a personal endeavor to understand the inner workings of compilers, from lexical analysis to code generation, and to provide a tailored compilation experience for my language.

## Motivation

I created Curious Compiler as a way to:
- Deepen my understanding of how compilers work
- Experiment with language design and implementation
- Provide a compilation toolchain customized for my language's unique features

## Features

- **Custom Language Support:** Parses and compiles source code written in my own programming language.
- **Lexical & Syntax Analysis:** Implements a lexer and parser for language tokenization and grammar checking.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Performs type checking and variable scope validation.
- **Code Generation:** Outputs executable code or bytecode for the target platform.
- **Error Reporting:** Provides descriptive error messages to help debug source code.
